Acknowledgements & Thanks:

- Under the hood I originally used Stephen Cleary's Nito.AsyncEx (http://nitoasyncex.codeplex.com/)
  library for parts of the async Queries. However, I've removed that dependency and replaced it with
  an integrated set of TFS compatible .FromAsync(...) methods.
  However for reference, license details for Nito.AsyncEx are available at:
